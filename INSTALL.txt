Steps to manually install the OpenOPC Gateway Service
-----------------------------------------------------

gbda_aut.dll

3. Open a command prompt and type:

cd \OpenOPC

Steps to manually remove the OpenOPC Gateway Service
----------------------------------------------------

1. Go into the Control Panel and stop the OpenOPC Gateway Service

2. Open a command prompt and type:

cd \OpenOPC
OpenOPCService.exe remove
regsvr32 /u gbda_aut.dll

3. Delete the entire C:\OpenOPC folder



Non-Windows Systems
-------------------
If you wish to use OpenOPC with Linux, Mac, or other non-Windows OS,
copy all the *.py files inside the src folder onto your non-Windows
system.   Then read the Developers section in the README.txt file to
ensure you have the necessary prerequisite Python modules installed.

You can then use OpenOPC to talk to the Gateway Service that you
installed above on one of your Windows boxes.  I recommend you install
the Gateway Service on the same box where your OPC server resides.
